                       <p>The Millau Viaduct is a cable-stayed bridge located in Southern France. It spans the Millau valley and the river Tarn. The bridge was designed by architect Norman Foster and structural engineer Michel Virlogeux.

                        The idea for the bridge was first discussed in 1987, as a solution to the heavy congestion caused by traffic passing through the town of Millau on its way to Spain. The bridge was built to relieve pressure on local roads and provide a faster connection between Paris and the Mediterranean.
                        
                        Construction of the bridge began in 2001 and it was opened in late 2004. At its peak, there were 500 people working on the project. The bridge is 2,460 meters long and its main span is 342 meters. It has 7 pillars and the bridge is 343 meters at its highest, making it 19 meters higher than the Eiffel Tower.
                        
                        The bridge has become a tourist attraction and has increased tourism in the city of Millau. It is known for its impressive design and engineering and is considered one of the world's greatest achievements in engineering.
                        
                        The bridge is made of steel and concrete and has a metallic deck with a total mass of around 36,000 tonnes. The deck is covered with modified bitumen, which is flexible but strong and can adapt to deformations under traffic while also being strong enough to resist road conditions.
                        
                        The bridge has several records, including the highest pylons in the world (245 meters and 221 meters), the highest bridge tower in the world (343 meters), and the highest road bridge deck in Europe (270 meters). It also has 7 masts, each 87 meters high and weighing 700 tonnes. Each mast has 11 anchored cables (stays) that support the road deck.
                        
                        The bridge has several electrical installations, including 30km of cables for high current, 20km of fiber-optics, 10 km of cable for low current, and 357 telephone sockets. Many instruments are installed on the masts, deck, pylons, and stays that monitor the state and detect changes and resistance of the viaduct to wear and tear. All information gathered from the instruments is analyzed and sent to the toll plaza, which is placed 4 km north of the viaduct. The bridge tollbooths and technical and commercial management are placed there. The toll plaza has sixteen lanes of traffic, eight in each direction.</p>
