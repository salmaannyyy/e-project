                        <p>The Helix Bridge is a pedestrian bridge in Singapore that spans the Marina Bay. It was designed by a team of architects and engineers from Arup and Cox Architecture, and it was completed in 2010. The bridge is 280 meters long and has a distinctive spiral design that is meant to evoke the structure of a DNA helix.

                            The bridge was built as part of a larger urban redevelopment project in the Marina Bay area, which aimed to create a new central business district and a vibrant waterfront destination for both residents and tourists. The Helix Bridge was designed to provide a pedestrian link between the Marina Bay Sands integrated resort and the Marina Centre, as well as to serve as a landmark and a symbol of the area.
                            
                            The bridge is made of stainless steel and has a total weight of about 650 tons. It has a double-helix structure that is formed by four spiral tubes, each of which is made up of three interlocking spirals. The bridge has a total of 12 interlocking spirals, which are arranged in a pattern that is meant to resemble the structure of a DNA helix. The bridge has a total of six landings, which provide access to various points along the waterfront.
                            
                            The Helix Bridge was opened to the public in April 2010, and it has since become a popular destination for both locals and tourists. It is illuminated at night with a series of LED lights that are integrated into the handrails, creating a visually striking effect. The bridge has also been used as a venue for various events, including concerts and art installations. It has won several awards for its design and engineering, including the Structural Steel Design Award in 2011 and the World Architecture Festival Award in 2010.</p>
